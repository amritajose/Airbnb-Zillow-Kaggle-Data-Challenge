A real estate company plans to purchase properties to rent out short-term as part of their business model specifically within New York City. 
The real estate company has already concluded that two bedroom properties are the most profitable. 
However, the company doesn't know which zip codes are the best to invest in.  The problem statement requires to clean, analyze and build 
a data product with conclusions and results that would identify the zip codes that would generate the most profit on short term rentals within New York City.

The two datasets used in the problem are publicly available data from Zillow and AirBnB which are described as below.

    - Cost Data: Zillow dataset that provides us an estimate of value for two-bedroom properties
    - Revenue Data: AirBnB is the medium through which the real estate company plans to lease out their investment property. 
      AirBnB dataset provides data on property listings in New York with details including number of bedrooms,neighbourhood,rent,availability among many others.

variables and profit/ROI projections.
